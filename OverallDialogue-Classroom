You enter the classroom. You try to take a look around, but the door behind you shut closed. 
You attempt to open it again, but the bunker is locked tight. Again, you look around:
There is a pillar in the middle of the room with 5 rows of tables sprawled out from left to right.
There is a clock in the left hanging on the wall. 
A desk sits alone in the upper right of the room and in the middle of the back is a locker attached to the wall.
