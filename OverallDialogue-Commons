You close the door behind you, and immediately run up the stairs into the commons. Finally at the first floor, you try the front doors, but to no avail. You tried the other doors as well, but it was no use. You decide to look around you.
There is the reception’s desk near the entrance.
The Avanti market that’s locked.
A gated area with clothes.
The rest of the commons is filled with tables and chairs, except the imaging bar.
