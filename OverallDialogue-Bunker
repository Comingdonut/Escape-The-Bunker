It’s been two weeks since the quarter has ended. I leave my dorm and head to the commons. The school is shutting down in 2 hours, so I decided to waste some time checking if the bunker is open. Surprisingly, it is open which is unusual. Tempted by the Wii-U in the back of the room, I figured a few games of Smash Bros. wouldn’t hurt. After eleven games, I slid down into the couch, not realizing what the time was, I felt my eyelids start to close which after a few blinks, I realized it was too late for me.

I open my eyes to find darkness surrounding me. I turned around to find a dim orange light behind me.

The school must be shut down. There needs to be a way out of the bunker. You look around the room.

To the left, there is a countertop with 3 TV’s and 5 game consoles and under it are two separate drawers. Near the entrance is the arcade machine with two recycling bins, a trash bin, and a large table.
In the middle of the room, there is a foosball table.
In the left side are three tables and in the right side is a single table.
In the back of the room, there are couches, a drawer and storage door.
