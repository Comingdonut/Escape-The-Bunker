It’s been two weeks since the quarter has ended. I leave my dorm and head to the commons. 
The school is shutting down in 2 hours, so I decided to waste some time checking if the bunker is open. 
Surprisingly, it is open which is unusual. Tempted by the Wii-U in the back of the room, I figured a few games of Smash Bros. wouldn’t hurt. 
After eleven games, I slid down into the couch, not realizing what the time was, I felt my eyelids start to close which after a few blinks, I realized it was too late for me.

I open my eyes to find darkness surrounding me. I turned around to find a dim orange light behind me.

The school must be shut down. There needs to be a way out of the bunker. You look around the room.

To the left, there is a countertop with a TV and under it are two separate drawers, one on the left, and one on the right. 
Near the entrance is the arcade machine, and a big table.
In the left side there is a long table and in the right side is a single table.
In the back of the room, there is couch, closet door and a classroom door.
There is a window next to the bunker door.
